                    <p>My name is Guillermo, people call me "G". I am originally from Argentina and have lived in the US since 2005. I am a published scientist in research magazines. I have worked in subjects such as cancer and preterm birth.</p><br><br>
                    <p>I love travelling and meeting people from different cultures and backgrounds. I enjoy cooking for friends and presenting them with something becautiful and delicious. I love outdoors, camping, sports (especially soccer) and being active.</p><br><br>
                    <p>I am passionate about software development. I have taken free and paid online courses for html, CSS and JavaScript/React. There is an anonymous quote I once heard and loved ever since, and I will never forget: "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life". I am lucky enough to say I have found that job!</p><br><br>
